<Callout>
  The Alaska is still in Prototype & Ideation stage, you will find missing
  documentation and many things will not work as expected. <br />I hope this documentation
  will help you to understand the architecture behind Alaska more clear

**Alaska** is idea for the next evolution of Collaborative Consumption & Peer-to-Peer sharing using Internet Computer blockchain.

> **Stage : Early Prototype as Ideation**
