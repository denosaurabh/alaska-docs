# Alaska

<Callout>
  The Alaska is still in Prototype & Ideation stage, you will find missing
  documentation and many things will not work as expected. <br />I hope this documentation
  will help you to understand the architecture behind Alaska more clear

  NOTE FOR ORGANISERS:

  There are 5 Repositories containing the entire Project including `Main Alaska Protocol`, `Alaska Indexer`, `Book Swap Vessel`, `Bike GPS Vessel` & `Alaska Docs`.
  All 5 Repos are private except this [docs](https://github.com/denosaurabh/alaska-docs). So, 4 repositories are Zipped in the submission :)
